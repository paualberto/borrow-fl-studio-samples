## What does this do?

Remove the WAV signature from FL Studio included samples, which are actually valid OGG files inside a WAV.

## Is this legal?

Code is just code and there is nothing proprietary or copyrighted in this repo. However please note that use of the 
FL Studio builtin samples is subject to their license, might be illegal, and I take no responsibility
for the use you do.

## How to use

Grab the executable and drag and drop unusable WAVs into it, OGGs will be created in the same origin folder. 

## Can you implement feature X?

Not at this time, but pull requests are accepted. Go is easy to write.
